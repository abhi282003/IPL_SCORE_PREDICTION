IPL Score Prediction Project Documentation
Overview:

This project is designed to predict the IPL score at each step of a cricket match using machine learning models.
The prediction is based on real-time data from the game such as runs, wickets, overs, etc., and aims to provide 
an accurate score projection for each over or phase of the game.

Dataset:

The dataset consists of the following key features:

Runs: The total runs scored at a particular stage.

Wickets: The number of wickets lost so far.

Overs: The number of overs completed in the innings.

Runs in Last 5 Overs: The runs scored in the last 5 overs.

Current Score: The score at the current phase of the match.

Other Features: Additional features such as team name, opponent, etc., could be included based on the dataset.


Workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
The data is first cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for model training:

Handling Missing Values: Fill or drop missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (such as team names) into numerical format.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize the features for consistent model performance.

2. Feature Selection
Important features for predicting the score include:

Runs scored.
Wickets taken.
Overs remaining.
Historical data (e.g., runs scored in previous IPL matches).

3. Model Building
You can use several machine learning models for score prediction:

Linear Regression: To model the relationship between overs, runs, and other features.
Random Forest: For better accuracy by building multiple decision trees.
XGBoost: A powerful model often used in sports prediction.

4. Model Training
Split the data into training and testing sets:

Training Set: Used to train the model.
Testing Set: Used to evaluate the model performance.

5. Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate the model using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To measure how close predictions are to actual scores.
R-Squared (RÂ²): To assess how well the model explains the variance in the data.

6. Real-Time Prediction
Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the score at any phase of an IPL match. Input features
such as current runs, wickets, and overs will be fed to the model to get the predicted score.
